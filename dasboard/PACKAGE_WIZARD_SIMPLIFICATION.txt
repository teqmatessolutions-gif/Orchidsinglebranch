PACKAGE WIZARD SIMPLIFICATION - REQUIRED CHANGES
================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
The frontend package wizard has 4 steps with many fields, but the backend
only supports 6 fields:
- title
- description
- price
- booking_type
- room_types
- images

All other fields (code, theme, revenue_split, inclusions, rules, etc.) are
being sent to the backend but NOT SAVED, causing edits to not persist.

SOLUTION:
---------
Simplify the package wizard to only 2 steps:

STEP 1: Package Details
- Package Name (title)
- Description
- Booking Type (room_type or whole_property)
- Room Types (if room_type selected)

STEP 2: Pricing & Images
- Package Price
- Images (at least 1 required)

CHANGES NEEDED:
---------------

1. ✅ DONE: Simplified formData state (removed unsupported fields)
2. ✅ DONE: Removed unsupported fields from handleWizardSubmit
3. ⏳ TODO: Simplify renderStep1 (remove code, theme, default_adults, default_children)
4. ⏳ TODO: Simplify renderStep2 (remove revenue_split, add images)
5. ⏳ TODO: Remove renderStep3 (inclusions)
6. ⏳ TODO: Remove renderStep4 (rules)
7. ⏳ TODO: Update wizard navigation to only show 2 steps
8. ⏳ TODO: Update step validation

MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED:
-----------------------
Due to line ending issues preventing automated edits, please make these
changes manually to c:\releasing\orchid\dasboard\src\pages\Package.jsx:

CHANGE 1: Simplify renderStep1 (around line 580-665)
Remove these fields from the form:
- Rate Code (code)
- Theme dropdown
- Default Adults
- Default Children

Keep only:
- Package Name (title)
- Description
- Booking Type
- Room Types selection

CHANGE 2: Simplify renderStep2 (around line 667-695)
Remove:
- Revenue Split section (lines 682-693)

Add:
- Image upload field (move from Step 4)

CHANGE 3: Delete renderStep3 and renderStep4 entirely

CHANGE 4: Update wizard navigation (around line 930-950)
Change from 4 steps to 2 steps:
- Step 1: "Details" (Settings icon)
- Step 2: "Pricing & Images" (DollarSign icon)

CHANGE 5: Update step navigation buttons (around line 945-955)
Change: {step < 4 ? ... : ...}
To:     {step < 2 ? ... : ...}

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
---------------------
If manual editing is too complex, I can create a completely new simplified
Package.jsx file with only the supported features. This would be cleaner
but would replace the entire file.

Would you like me to:
A) Create a new simplified Package.jsx file (recommended)
B) Provide detailed line-by-line manual edit instructions
C) Try to add the missing fields to the backend database (requires migration)
