PACKAGE FIELDS - COMPLETE STATUS
=================================

✅ COMPLETED:
-------------
1. Database Migration - All fields added to packages table
2. Package Model (Package.py) - Updated with new fields
3. Frontend (Package.jsx) - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN with all new fields!

⏳ REMAINING:
-------------
The backend API needs to accept the new fields. The frontend is sending them,
but the backend isn't saving them yet.

BACKEND UPDATE NEEDED:
----------------------

File: c:\releasing\orchid\ResortApp\app\curd\packages.py
Function: create_package (line 12)

CURRENT SIGNATURE:
def create_package(db: Session, title: str, description: str, price: float, image_urls: List[str], booking_type: str = "room_type", room_types: str = None):

NEEDS TO BE:
def create_package(db: Session, title: str, description: str, price: float, image_urls: List[str], booking_type: str = "room_type", room_types: str = None, theme: str = None, default_adults: int = 2, default_children: int = 0, max_stay_days: int = None, food_included: str = None):

And in the Package creation (line 14-19), ADD:
    pkg = Package(
        title=title, 
        description=description, 
        price=price,
        booking_type=booking_type,
        room_types=room_types,
        theme=theme,                      # ADD THIS
        default_adults=default_adults,    # ADD THIS
        default_children=default_children,# ADD THIS
        max_stay_days=max_stay_days,      # ADD THIS
        food_included=food_included       # ADD THIS
    )

File: c:\releasing\orchid\ResortApp\app\api\packages.py
Functions: create_package_api (line 26), create_package_api_slash (line 111), update_package_api (line 197)

ADD THESE PARAMETERS TO ALL THREE FUNCTIONS:
    theme: str = Form(None),
    default_adults: int = Form(2),
    default_children: int = Form(0),
    max_stay_days: int = Form(None),
    food_included: str = Form(None),

And pass them to crud_package.create_package:
    return crud_package.create_package(db, title, description, price, image_urls, booking_type, room_types, theme, default_adults, default_children, max_stay_days, food_included)

For update_package_api, also UPDATE the package fields (around line 227-231):
    package.title = title
    package.description = description
    package.price = price
    package.booking_type = booking_type
    package.room_types = room_types
    package.theme = theme                      # ADD THIS
    package.default_adults = default_adults    # ADD THIS
    package.default_children = default_children# ADD THIS
    package.max_stay_days = max_stay_days      # ADD THIS
    package.food_included = food_included      # ADD THIS

FRONTEND STATUS:
----------------
✅ ALL FIELDS ARE IN THE FORM!
✅ ALL FIELDS ARE BEING SENT TO THE BACKEND!

When you edit a package, you'll see:
- Theme dropdown
- Default Adults (number input)
- Default Children (number input)
- Maximum Stay Days (number input)
- Food Included (checkboxes for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)

The package list also shows these fields when viewing packages.

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Update the backend files as described above
2. Restart the backend server (run_local.bat)
3. Refresh the frontend
4. Test creating/editing a package

All the fields you requested are now in the frontend!
Just need the backend to save them.
