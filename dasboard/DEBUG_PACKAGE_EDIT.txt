IMMEDIATE STEPS TO TEST PACKAGE EDIT
=====================================

I've added debug logging to help us see what's happening.

STEP 1: Open Browser Console
-----------------------------
1. Open your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Click on the "Console" tab
4. Keep this open

STEP 2: Try Editing the Package
--------------------------------
1. Go to Package Management page
2. Click "Edit" on the honeymoon package
3. Change the price from ₹10,000 to ₹15,000
4. Go through all 4 steps
5. On Step 4, click "Update Package"

STEP 3: Check Console for Debug Messages
-----------------------------------------
Look for these messages in the console:
- "[PACKAGE UPDATE] Updating package ID: 1"
- "API Request: put /packages/1"

STEP 4: Check for Errors
-------------------------
If you see any RED error messages in the console, copy them and share them with me.

Common errors to look for:
- "401 Unauthorized" = Auth token issue
- "400 Bad Request" = Missing required fields
- "404 Not Found" = Wrong API endpoint
- "500 Internal Server Error" = Backend error

STEP 5: Check Network Tab
--------------------------
1. In Developer Tools, click "Network" tab
2. Try updating the package again
3. Look for a request to "packages/1" with method "PUT"
4. Click on it
5. Check:
   - Status code (should be 200)
   - Request Headers (should have "Authorization: Bearer ...")
   - Response (what the server returned)

WHAT TO SHARE WITH ME:
-----------------------
1. Any console error messages (red text)
2. The status code from the Network tab
3. Whether you see the debug message "[PACKAGE UPDATE] Updating package ID: 1"

This will help me identify exactly where the problem is!
